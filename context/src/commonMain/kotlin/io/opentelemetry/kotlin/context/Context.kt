package io.opentelemetry.kotlin.context

/**
 * A context propagation mechanism which can carry scoped-values across API boundaries and between
 * threads.
 *
 * A Context object can be [set][.makeCurrent] to the [ContextStorage], which effectively forms a
 * **scope** for the context. The scope is bound to the current thread. Within a scope, its Context
 * is accessible even across API boundaries, through [.current]. The scope is later exited by
 * [Scope.close] closing} the scope.
 *
 * Context objects are immutable and inherit state from their parent. To add or overwrite the
 * current state a new context object must be created and then attached, replacing the previously
 * bound context. For example:
 *
 * <pre>`Context withCredential = Context.current().with(CRED_KEY, cred); withCredential.wrap(new
 * Runnable() { public void run() { readUserRecords(userId, CRED_KEY.get()); } }).run(); `</pre> *
 *
 * Notes and cautions on use:
 *
 * * Every [.makeCurrent] must be followed by a [Scope.close]. Breaking these rules may lead to
 * memory leaks and incorrect scoping.
 * * While Context objects are immutable they do not place such a restriction on the state they
 * store.
 * * Context is not intended for passing optional parameters to an API and developers should take
 * care to avoid excessive dependence on context when designing an API.
 * * Attaching Context from a different ancestor will cause information in the current Context to be
 * lost. This should generally be avoided.
 *
 * Context propagation is not trivial, and when done incorrectly can lead to broken traces or even
 * mixed traces. We provide a debug mechanism for context propagation, which can be enabled by
 * setting `-Dio.opentelemetry.kotlin.context.enableStrictContext=true` in your JVM args. This will
 * enable a strict checker that makes sure that [Scope]s are closed on the correct thread and that
 * they are not garbage collected before being closed. This is done with some relatively expensive
 * stack trace walking. It is highly recommended to enable this in unit tests and staging
 * environments, and you may consider enabling it in production if you have the CPU budget or have
 * very strict requirements on context being propagated correctly (i.e., because you use context in
 * a multi-tenant system). For kotlin coroutine users, this will also detect invalid usage of [
 * ][.makeCurrent] from coroutines and suspending functions. This detection relies on internal APIs
 * of kotlin coroutines and may not function across all versions - let us know if you find a version
 * of kotlin coroutines where this mechanism does not function.
