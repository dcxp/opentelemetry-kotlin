/**
 * A utility for returning wall times anchored to a given point in time. Wall time measurements will
 * not be taken from the system, but instead are computed by adding [ monotonic time]
 * [System.nanoTime] to the anchor point.
 *
 * This is needed because Java has lower granularity for epoch times and tracing events are recorded
 * more often. There is also a performance improvement in avoiding referencing the system's wall
 * time where possible. Instead of computing a true wall time for every timestamp within a trace, we
 * compute it once at the local root and then anchor all descendant span timestamps to this root's
 * timestamp.
